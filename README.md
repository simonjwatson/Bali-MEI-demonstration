# Bali MEI Practical Demonstration

Here we'll look at the **H3N2** isolates sampled in **Bali** by phylogenetically placing them in the context of the global isolates.

If you'll remember from the talk, we got no sequence back for the HA and NA gene segments, so we will look at the PB2 gene segment, which we got 17 sequences back.

### Phylogenetically placing the Balinese H3N2 PB2 sequences

1. Download all files by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button at the top right

2. The Balinese sequences can be found in the `Bali-sequences` folder as `Bali-MEI.H3N2.PB2.fas`

This is a plain text FASTA file and can be opened in any text editor to view the sequences.
